Form creation and styling

Create a registration form that would be production-ready. The form should have the following fields:

First Name
Last Name
Phone
Email
Short Bio (textarea with 1000 characters maximum)
The form should be responsive and have two primary modes: browser and mobile. Use css to accomplish the responsive behavior.

Wireframes are provided as PDf's (we're all about creative directory naming...). The dotted lines are meant to indicate alignment.

Please any images provided in the repository to leverage in your design.

Place all of your HTML in the index.html and all your CSS inside styles.css. Please do not use any other external css libraries (bootstrap, material UI, etc).

Do not worry about making any links work, or form(s) posting. You are encouraged to make the form visually appealing with intuative UI, error states etc. That being said, you are not being judged on your design sensabilities- we're more concerned that your work meets the criteria layed out and that you pay attention to detail and have the design skills needed.  We want to see how you handle the task using as much production quality CSS as possible.
